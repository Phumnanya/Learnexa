# Learnexa

is an e-learning website I developed as a software engineering student at ALX.
it is a 4 page web app that comprises of the home page, sign up, log in, and user dashboard layouts with LMS that tracks the progress of the user.
in the home page the user is able to view the options and courses available to him to choose from.
on the dashboard page, the user can access his quiz tests available to him based on the options he has chosen. he can also edit his profile and see achieve ments, and also view his progress curve and charts.
